# 1. Description 

This is a progress web app storing the user's transaction histories and displaying net amount of the user's assets. 

By using manifest and service worker, this app is able to cache the user's input locally at indexeddb while the device is offline. And once it's back to online, push local data to backend mongoDB database.
